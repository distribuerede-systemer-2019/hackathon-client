# Hackathon 2019 - CLIENT

## How to initialize
1. Open your terminal (or git bash or whatever) and navigate to the folder you want to store your client in.
2. Clone this project
3. Open IntelliJ and import project with existing sources and maven. Remember to import maven. This can be done by clicking the popâ€™up and selecting `import`. Else you can right click the `pom.xml` file and select `maven` and `import`
7. Run your Client by right clicking `Client.java` and run it's main method
8. If everything works, you should get a customer back, when running the first method.

## Implement methods!
Implement all the methods, you have implemented in your server. Remember to take a look at both the functional- and non functional requirements (can be found in the server readme: https://github.com/distribuerede-systemer-2019/hackathon-server) to make sure that you actually fulfill everything on both server- and client-side.
